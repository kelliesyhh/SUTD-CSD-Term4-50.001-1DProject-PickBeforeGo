## Overview - Pick Before Go
Tired of going to Pick & GO only to find out that the item you want to buy is out of stock? Want to stay updated on promotions of the most popular items? Introducing the Pick Before Go app, a revamped user experience where users can get the most out of their Pick & GO experience.

Opening the app brings you to our home screen, with the classic QR code for entry and a promotion carousel to view the current promotions in store. To browse through the product catalogue on your way to Pick & GO, simply use the search bar in the app to search for any product and tap on it. Not only will you be able to see its availability, you will also get to see a short description about it! You can even favourite items for quick access.

But Pick & GO wouldn’t survive without the operational staff restocking the items everyday. With special administrator privileges, staff can also use the app as an inventory tool for operational tasks such as updating the promotions and availability of items. They can also easily add a new product if needed!

With Pick Before Go, shopping at Pick & GO has never been easier and fuss-free!

## Problem Statement
As shoppers and users of the Pick & GO app, we want to be aware of the availability of the stock of our favourite products at any point in time. Additionally, to save money and time, we want to be informed of upcoming promotions.

Personally, we want to know when products would be restocked, so that we can make plans for future purchases accordingly. We also want to know if a product is out of stock, so that we can make an informed choice before patronising Pick & GO. However, the current app offers none of these features. All that can be done on the app is generating a QR code to enter the shop, viewing past purchases and viewing possible rewards. As such, we see the significance in developing this solution for ourselves and our peers, especially for those facing similar issues as us.
